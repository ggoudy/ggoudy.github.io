### What to expect from the Blog

The focus of this blog will be on Information Systems Security Architecture and Vulnerability Analysis. New vulnerabilities are found everyday and it's important to have high quality blog posts covering those vulnerabilities. More specifically, the goal of this blog is to cover vulnerabilities and the relevant system/network security architectures or product patches that can be deployed to combat them.
